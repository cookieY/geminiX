  // driver scripts/run-csp-e2e.mjs) and is excluded here so the mock
  // regression baseline never executes it against a CSP-less server.

  // decides whether p95 fits. The rest of the suite still runs in parallel.

  // Tolerance, honestly derived: `threshold: 0.2` (a Playwright default) already
  // treats any single pixel within 0.2 YIQ distance as identical, so the
  // 2–39 px / ≤6 per channel anti-aliasing wobble measured on the reference
  // platform produces *zero* diff pixels. `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01` therefore
  // does not absorb that noise — it absorbs what was not measured: anti-aliased
  // edges that occasionally cross the 0.2 boundary, and browser-build drift
  // (Playwright pins a chromium revision, and a dependency bump can change it;
  // the committed baselines are only valid for the pinned build). 12960 px on a
  // 1440×900 frame stays far tighter than a structural regression (a missing
  // sidebar, a shifted column or a broken theme each move several percent).
  //
  // Known blind spot this creates: a *uniform, low-amplitude* colour shift
  // (every channel inside 0.2 YIQ) passes at any area — the ratio cannot catch
  // it, and a chromium upgrade turns all 116 baselines red at once.
  //
  // `animations`, `caret` and `scale` below restate Playwright defaults; they
  // are written out so a future config edit cannot silently re-enable them,
  // not because this package calibrated them.
  //
  // Todo: a global template also covers `toMatchAriaSnapshot`, whose default
  // lives in a different path — any future aria snapshot would land in
  // tests/screenshots/*.yml. Nothing uses it today; scope the template before
  // adding one.
  //
  // Platform caveat: no CI workflow runs Playwright today, so baselines are
  // only produced and compared on macOS. If e2e is ever wired into Linux CI,
  // this template needs a {platform} segment plus a Linux baseline set.
