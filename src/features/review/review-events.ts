 * Lifecycle owner for the shared domain-event feed (frontend PRD §11.6: the
 * event client is a singleton and components never open their own stream).
 * The workspace page starts it on mount and stops it on unmount; the client's
 * resume point survives across pages, so a remount continues the feed without
 * re-consumed events.
 *
 * Transport selection: the api-conventions contract keeps HTTP polling as the
 * first-release baseline and the real backend stream wires in F12 — under
 * VITE_ENABLE_MOCK the stateful fixture transport drives the client so E2E
 * exercises the exact ingest/dedup/sequence semantics.
