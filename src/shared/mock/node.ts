/**
 * Node transport for the mock world (owner ruling 2026-11-04, MSW 多标签页
 * 方案一): booted by the vite dev-server plugin (vite.config.ts), it gives
 * every tab, browser and LAN device ONE authoritative in-memory world instead
 * of the per-tab browser workers. Vitest keeps its own in-process servers;
 * `vite preview` / mock e2e builds keep the browser worker (browser.ts).
 *
 * The setupServer is a PROCESS-LEVEL SINGLETON guarded on globalThis:
 * msw 2.15's experimental network layer does not reliably detach its
 * interceptors on close(), so every fresh instance kept answering requests
 * alongside the older ones (duplicate handler resolutions, already-consumed
 * bodies). The dev server instead refreshes the ONE live server through
 * `resetHandlers` whenever fixtures change — see mockNodePlugin in
 * vite.config.ts, which loads the handler modules via ssrLoadModule and
 * feeds `baseHandlers()` into the server returned by
 * `ensureMockNodeServer`. The msw cookie jar and interceptors
 * live in msw's own (externalized) module cache, so sessions survive those
 * refreshes exactly like a backend surviving a config reload.
 *
 * This module stays free of node built-ins on purpose: it lives in src/, is
 * type-checked by the app tsconfig (no node types), and is loaded by the dev
 * server through `server.ssrLoadModule`. msw/node intercepts OUTGOING
 * ClientRequests — the connect middleware in vite.config.ts bridges incoming
 * dev-server requests onto that surface via a loopback sink. Every handler
 * path is an asterisk wildcard, so the loopback host/port never affects
 * matching.
