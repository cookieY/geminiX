/**
 * One-shot count-up for stat displays (owner 2026-10-23: "首页内的数值展示
 * 要加上动效"). The number ticks 0 → value once when the data lands, then
 * settles; a later refresh ticks from whatever is on screen to the new value,
 * so the motion always means "this number just changed" instead of decorating
 * a static page.
 *
 * Deliberate choices:
 * - 1000ms, longer than the 500ms UI-*transition* ceiling in AGENTS.md on
 *   purpose. That ceiling governs transitions (hover, popovers, sheets) where
 *   latency reads as sluggishness. A count-up is a data animation whose whole
 *   job is to be legible: the first pass at 500ms with an expo curve dumped 59%
 *   of the distance into the first 100ms and the owner's verdict was "眼睛都没
 *   反应过来就结束了" (2026-10-23). Nothing loops: the spec forbids continuous
 *   animation without business meaning.
 * - `prefers-reduced-motion` renders the final value immediately — the same
 *   preference the CSS layer already honours, read here because this animation
 *   is driven from JavaScript and cannot be neutralised by the stylesheet.
 * - The span owns its text node and React never renders children into it. A
 *   parent re-render during the tick (a sibling query resolving, a theme
 *   toggle) would otherwise re-render the settled value for one frame before
 *   the next rAF frame overwrites it — a visible flicker. With no children,
 *   React's diff has nothing to write, and the tick stays authoritative.
 * - `useLayoutEffect` paints the first frame before the browser paints, so the
 *   number never flashes its target and then jumps back to zero.
 * - `tabular-nums` belongs to the caller's class list: ticking digits must not
 *   reflow the label beside them.
