 * routes follow docs/contracts/frontend-ui-migration-contract.md §2.
 *
 * Presentation-layer visibility is NOT an authorization boundary — the backend
 * remains default-deny. Fine-grained per-capability filtering (frozen-flow
 * approvers, query grants, audit visibility) consumes real server
 * capabilities from FE-F3 on; until then only the two admin-only groups are
 * filtered here.
